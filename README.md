# Ti (Time in)
Currently Learning Flutter so decided to make an app that can convert timezones, store my favorite timezones and provide other features 
like stop watch, timer, alarm etc...

As stated, this is a learning exercise, please don't expect this to be perfectly coded, much support or for it to even work.
